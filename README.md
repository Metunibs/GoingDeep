# GoingDeep

This is a practical codelab that follow the Data_Scientist_for_a_day <https://github.com/alessandroferrari/Data_Scientist_for_a_Day> with the aim to guide beginners from the discipline of machine learning and classification into the deep learning side, by means of open source tools. 

The tutorial lab explains you the tools that you need to understand in order to develop a classification solution of this kind. By completion of the source code, you will have a working solution for classifying on a kaggle competition dataset. The kaggle dataset competition is the London Data Science competition.

This tutorial is intended to be connected to the intorductory part that you could find here <https://github.com/alessandroferrari/Deep-learning-An-Historical-perspective-slides> and is based on the pycaffe notebook brewing-logreg.

You are free to use this codelab for your seminars, for you courses or for your own education, but you have to give credits at the author for his work.
